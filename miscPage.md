# Additional information about the project

## Next Steps
Moving forward with the project we would like for the bot to recognize its own powerups and change its gameplay accordingly. Right now the bot only accounts for the standard bomb, exploding only one square away. However with the fire powerups this changes. While also making levels easier to clear, the bot currently cannot adjust for it.

Additionally we would also like for it to have a stronger directive to clear levels as opposed to just surviving. Because it is based on human player data that was specifically skewed to destroying all bricks, the bot more closely mimics this playstyle. We chose this as the training data because it was easier on and more reliable for humans to attempt.
