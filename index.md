# The Bomberman Bot
Our Bomberman Bot is a nerual net taught program that plays the classic arcade game, Bomberman. From saving the gameplay of our team, along with some hardcoded AI sessions, we fed the nerual net this training data to recognize the most likely correct command to use.

We took this project on as we all love video games and all took an interest in machine learning. Being most of our's first venture into machine learning, we wanted to tackle a project we all knew we'd be invested in.
