# Code Architecture
Our code is broken up into two main components, the feature extraction code, implemented directly into the base pygame code, and the neural net, which reads from and makes decisions outside of the game.

## Feature Extraction
Shifti

## Neural Net
To implement the neural net, we used the open source and widely used TensorFlow library, allowing us to pass in the extracted features, which are then considered and combined to weight the six possible commands and ultimately chose one for the bomberman to perform.
